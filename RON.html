    <h4><p>Encounter #1: Cataclysm</p></h4>
    <p><h5>The first major encounter of Root of Nightmares is Cataclysm. This encounter requires you to connect nodes throught a large map.<br> 
        You can connect these nodes by standing in an aura that will give you a buff called "Feild of Light". This buff will allow you connect these nodes one by one until you finish the encounter. </h5></p>

    <h4><p>Encounter #2: Scission</p></h4>
    <p><h5 >The second encounter (Scission) expands on the mechanic introduced in the first. This time, however, there are Light nodes and Dark nodes.
      <br>The Light nodes still grants Field of Light, but the Dark nodes grants Flux of Darkness.<br> Connect these nodes while ascending up to complete the encounter.
    </h5></p>

    <h4><p>Encounter #3: Macrocosm</p></h4>
    <p><h5>Macrocosm is the first major boss battle of Root of Nightmares.
        After the encounter starts, Centurian enemies will spawn near the back of the room.<br>
         Defeat them to spawn a Colossus on each of the platforms. Killing the Colossus will grant Planetary Insight, which shows you if a planet is Light or Dark on your side of the room.<br>
         All of the Light planets should be on the left side of the room, and all of the Dark planets on the right. Find the odd one out and interact with it. <br>
         This will allow you to damage the boss, repeat this until he is dead.
    </h5></p>

    <h4><p>Encounter #4: Nezarec</p></h4>
    <p><h5>The final boss of the Root of Nightmares raid is Nezarec, Final God of Pain. The goal is to extend nodes on both sides of the room to start the damage phase.<br>
    If you do this fast enough you should have no problem dealing damage phases until Nezarec is dead.</h5></p>
