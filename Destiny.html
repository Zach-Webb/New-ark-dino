    <h3><p><u>What Is A Raid?</u></p></h3>
    <p><h4>A Fireteam(of 6 people) embarks on a difficult quest to defeat a final boss,<br> and when it succeeds, the feeling of accomplishment is beyond comparison.</h4></p>
    <hr>
    <p>Destiny makes these raids with different mechanics involved in each one that sets it apart from the others.
        <br> Fireteams must learn and perform these mechanics in order to defeat a final boss at the end of the raid.</p>
