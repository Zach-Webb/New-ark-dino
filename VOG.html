    <h3><p>Encounters</p></h3>
    <h4><p>Encounter #1: Waking Ruins</p></h4>
    <p><h5>To access the Vault, players must activate three Vex plates outside its front door, and keep them activated continuously for five minutes.<br>
        This builds a spire in the middle of the area, which unlocks the gate.</p></h5>
    <hr></h5>
    <h4><p>Encounter #2: Templar</p></h4>
    <p><h5>As you approch the Templar's area you will see a Relic shield called The Aegis in the center of the room.<br>
    Upon picking this up you will start the first boss encounter of this raid. The Templar is surrounded in a white shield that prevents it from being damaged, except by the Relicâ€™s Super ability.
    <br> When hit by the super the shield will be broken allowing damage until the Templar is dead.
</h5></p>
    <hr>
    <h4><p>Encounter #3: Atheon</p></h4>
    <p><h5>This is the final boss encounter in the raid. Early in the fight, Atheon teleports three of your teammates to either Mars or Venus.
        <br> There on either Mars or Venus you will see the same Relic from the Templar encounter. Once again you must build up a super on the Relic.
<br> Then the three teammates still in the boss room must shot Atheons side depending on if they are on Mars or Venus. <br>
Then the person with the Relic will break Ateon's shield allowing other teammates to damage the boss until he is dead.</h5></p>
